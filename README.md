# Hi, I'm Matt 👋

I'm a full-stack developer with a growing focus on AI, Python, and chess analytics. My current project — *Delphium* — combines traditional chess engines with modern LLMs to help players analyze their games, discover patterns, and improve.

### 🧩 Interests & Work

- 🧠 Building AI tools using OpenAI, LangChain, and custom Python pipelines
- ♟️ Chess improvement through large-scale PGN + Stockfish analysis
